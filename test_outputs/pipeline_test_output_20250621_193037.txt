2. REQUIREMENTS ANALYSIS
==================================================
Document: Calculator_Requirements_Doc.pdf
Total Requirements: 5
Summary: Document contains 5 requirement tickets: - High priority: 4 - Medium priority: 1 - Low priority: 0 - Total features: 18

Requirements Details:

Requirement 1:
  Title: Calculator Display Component
  Priority: High
  Description: Provide a single, always-visible display panel that shows the current input and/or result. The panel must resize gracefully across devices while maintaining readability....
  Features: Numeric output up to 12 digits (defaults to scientific notation beyond), Distinct style for “in-progress” expression vs. final result, Auto-scroll or shrink font when length exceeds display width, Read-only interaction (no manual typing into display)
  Acceptance Criteria: Input “12 + 7 =” renders 19 in large font, Long operations (e.g., 123456789 * 99999) wrap or shrink without overflowing container, Display resets to “0” after “AC” is pressed

Requirement 2:
  Title: Numeric & Operator Buttons
  Priority: High
  Description: Create a grid of tactile buttons for digits 0–9, decimal point, arithmetic operators, equals, and clear actions....
  Features: Distinct visual grouping: digits vs. operators, Hover/focus states for accessibility, Data-test attributes for automated demo scripts (e.g., data-test= “btn-5”), Ripple or press animation under 100 ms
  Acceptance Criteria: Clicking 9, +, 1, = updates display to 10, “×” and “÷” use multiplication and division logic (no Unicode errors), All buttons are reachable via Tab key in logical order

Requirement 3:
  Title: Arithmetic Computation Engine
  Priority: High
  Description: Handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division without using JavaScript’s eval()....
  Features: Support operation chaining (e.g., 2 + 3 x 4 = 14), Respect operator precedence (× / higher than + –), Floating-point precision up to 6 decimal places, Graceful handling of division by zero
  Acceptance Criteria: x 3 - 2 = 19, / 0 shows Error and disables = until reset, Results are rounded: 0.1 + 0.2 = 0.3 (not 0.3000000004)

Requirement 4:
  Title: Clear & All-Clear Functionality
  Priority: Medium
  Description: Provide two reset actions—C (Clear Last Entry) and AC (All Clear)....
  Features: “C” removes the most recent token (digit / operator), “AC” resets full calculator state to default “0”, Button labels adapt on small screens: “C” & “AC” → icons
  Acceptance Criteria: Enter 8 8 + then press “C” → only last + is cleared, Press “AC” at any point and display shows “0”; history is empty

Requirement 5:
  Title: Decimal & Negative Number Support
  Priority: High
  Description: Allow users to enter numbers with decimals and toggle sign....
  Features: Single decimal point per number (auto-ignore extras), “±” toggle flips sign of current entry or result, Input validation prevents “. .” or “--5” edge cases
  Acceptance Criteria: +- shows -3.14, registers as 0.5, Consecutive “±” presses alternate sign each time
