1. CODEBASE ANALYSIS
==================================================
Architecture: The application is built using Python as the primary programming language. It utilizes a microservices architecture with a CLI tool and a Python package for ingestion. The application also includes a server component built using a Python web framework, likely FastAPI given the presence of routers and server configuration files.
Main Features: Ingesting Git repositories into a text format suitable for LLMs, Providing a CLI tool for easy usage, Offering a Python package for integration into other applications, Supporting private repositories with GitHub Personal Access Tokens
Dependencies: Python 3.8+, GitHub Personal Access Token (for private repositories), Various Python packages listed in requirements.txt and requirements-dev.txt
Key Components: gitingest CLI tool, gitingest Python package, Server component for handling queries and serving content, Browser extensions for Chrome, Firefox, and Edge
User Flows: Users can ingest a Git repository by providing a URL or a local directory path using the CLI tool or Python package, Users can access the ingested content through the server component, which can be queried using specific URLs or through the browser extensions, For private repositories, users need to provide a GitHub Personal Access Token either as an option or environment variable

Document: Calculator_Requirements_Doc.pdf
Total Requirements: 5
Summary: Document contains 5 requirement tickets: - High priority: 4 - Medium priority: 1 - Low priority: 0 - Total features: 0

Requirements Details:

Requirement 1:
  Title: Calculator Display Component Priority: High Description: Provide a single, always-visible display panel that shows the current input and/or result. The panel must resize gracefully across devices while maintaining readability. Features: • Numeric output up to 12 digits (defaults to scientific notation beyond) • Distinct style for “in-progress” expression vs. final result • Auto-scroll or shrink font when length exceeds display width • Read-only interaction (no manual typing into display) Acceptance Criteria: • Input “12 + 7 =” renders 19 in large font • Long operations (e.g., 123456789 * 99999) wrap or shrink without overflowing container • Display resets to “0” after “AC” is pressed Technical Notes: Use a dedicated <Display /> React component that accepts a value prop. Implement dynamic font sizing with CSS clamp() or calc() and test at 320 px width.
  Priority: High
  Description: REQUIREMENT 1:...
  Features: 
  Acceptance Criteria: 

Requirement 2:
  Title: Numeric & Operator Buttons Priority: High Description: Create a grid of tactile buttons for digits 0–9, decimal point, arithmetic operators, equals, and clear actions. Features: • Distinct visual grouping: digits vs. operators • Hover/focus states for accessibility • Data-test attributes for automated demo scripts (e.g., data-test="btn-5") • Ripple or press animation under 100 ms Acceptance Criteria: • Clicking 9, +, 1, = updates display to 10 • “×” and “÷” use multiplication and division logic (no Unicode errors) • All buttons are reachable via Tab key in logical order Technical Notes: Implement each button as a reusable <CalcButton /> component with props for label, value, and onClick.
  Priority: High
  Description: REQUIREMENT 2:...
  Features: 
  Acceptance Criteria: 

Requirement 3:
  Title: Arithmetic Computation Engine Priority: High Description: Handle addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division without using JavaScript’s eval(). Features: • Support operation chaining (e.g., 2 + 3 × 4 = 14) • Respect operator precedence (× / higher than + –) • Floating-point precision up to 6 decimal places • Graceful handling of division by zero Acceptance Criteria: • 7 × 3 – 2 = 19 • 5 ÷ 0 shows Error and disables = until reset • Results are rounded: 0.1 + 0.2 = 0.3 (not 0.3000000004) Technical Notes: Use an infix-to-RPN converter or incremental evaluation stack. Write unit tests for >20 edge cases with Jest.
  Priority: High
  Description: REQUIREMENT 3:...
  Features: 
  Acceptance Criteria: 

Requirement 4:
  Title: Clear & All-Clear Functionality Priority: Medium Description: Provide two reset actions—C (Clear Last Entry) and AC (All Clear). Features: • “C” removes the most recent token (digit / operator) • “AC” resets full calculator state to default “0” • Button labels adapt on small screens: “C” & “AC” → icons Acceptance Criteria: • Enter 8 8 + then press “C” → only last + is cleared • Press “AC” at any point and display shows “0”; history is empty Technical Notes: Maintain history stack; pop last token on “C”. Ensure long-press on “C” triggers “AC” on touch devices.
  Priority: Medium
  Description: REQUIREMENT 4:...
  Features: 
  Acceptance Criteria: 

Requirement 5:
  Title: Decimal & Negative Number Support Priority: High Description: Allow users to enter numbers with decimals and toggle sign. Features: • Single decimal point per number (auto-ignore extras) • “±” toggle flips sign of current entry or result • Input validation prevents “. .” or “--5” edge cases Acceptance Criteria: • 3 . 1 4 ± shows -3.14 • 0 . . 5 registers as 0.5 • Consecutive “±” presses alternate sign each time Technical Notes: Use regex or FSM for input parsing; store numbers as strings until evaluation to avoid JS float quirks.
