GitIngest + LLM Integration Examples
====================================

This file demonstrates practical ways to use gitingest output with LLM calls.
The key is understanding what gitingest returns and how to structure it for LLMs.

    CONTENT:
    {content}

    Generate a step-by-step action guide for demonstrating this application's functionality. Focus on creating a list of specific actions that can be performed to showcase the app's features.

    For each demonstration step, provide:

    1. **Action**: The specific action to perform (click button, enter text, navigate to page, etc.)
    2. **Target**: What element to interact with (button name, input field, link, etc.)
    3. **Input Data**: Any specific text, values, or data to enter
    4. **Expected Outcome**: What should happen after the action

    Structure this as a numbered sequence of actions that flow logically through the application's main features. Focus on:
    - User interface interactions (clicks, inputs, selections)
    - Navigation between different parts of the app
    - Data entry and form submissions
    - Key feature demonstrations with specific examples
    - Different user workflows or scenarios

    Keep descriptions concise and action-focused. Each step should be clear enough that someone could automate it or follow it exactly.
    The script should go over each main feature of the application only once

    Format as a complete Python file that can be run with `playwright test` or `pytest`.

    Focus on performing the demo actions, not validating results.
    Use the repository context to better understand the application structure and choose appropriate selectors
    Output only the Python code itself, starting directly with import statements. Do not wrap the code in markdown code blocks or any other formatting.
    Generate the code without any markdown formatting. Do not include ```python or ``` markers. Output only the raw Python code that can be saved directly to a .py file.
    Also add delays between actions to simulate human input.
